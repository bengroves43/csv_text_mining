# csv_text_mining
This is how to text mine from a csv file
The code uses R to mine text and create a list of the most frequent words for hotel reviews.
Then, it produces a word cloud of the top 20 words.
You can use this for most .csv files.
Stemming has not been done and that will be added in shortly.
Enjoy!
